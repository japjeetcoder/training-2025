# Linux Command Practice  
**Date:** 2025-06-27

Today I performed various tasks involving file permissions, user management, and shell scripting in Linux.

---

## 🔐 File Permissions and Ownership
- **`chmod 777 harshill.txt`** — Gave full read, write, and execute permissions to everyone.
- **`sudo useradd ravi`** — Added a new user named `ravi`.
- **`sudo chown ravi harshill.txt`** — Changed ownership of `harshill.txt` to user `ravi`.
- **`sudo chgrp ravi harshill.txt`** — Changed the group of `harshill.txt` to `ravi`.

## 📝 Shell Script Creation
- **`nano script.sh`** — Created a shell script file.
- **Script contents:**
  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "Welcome"
  echo "Enter two numbers:"
  read a
  read b
  sum=$((a + b))
  echo "Sum is $sum"
  ```

## 🧠 Logic in Script
- **If-Else Block:** Compared two numbers and printed the greater one.
  ```bash
  if [ $a -gt $b ]
  then
      echo "$a is greater"
  else
      echo "$b is greater"
  fi
  ```

- **For Loop:** Printed numbers from 1 to 5.
  ```bash
  for i in {1..5}
  do
      echo "Number: $i"
  done
  ```

## ⚙️ Executing and Modifying Script
- **`chmod -x script.sh`** — Removed execute permission.
- **`chmod +x script.sh`** — Re-added execute permission.
- **`./script.sh`** — Ran the script.

## 🧮 Additional Scripts

### ➕ Calculator Script
Performed basic arithmetic operations:
```bash
echo "Enter two numbers:"
read a
read b
echo "Addition: $((a + b))"
echo "Subtraction: $((a - b))"
echo "Multiplication: $((a * b))"
echo "Division: $((a / b))"
```

### 📂 File Existence Check Script
Checked whether a given file exists:
```bash
echo "Enter filename:"
read file

if [ -f "$file" ]
then
    echo "File exists."
else
    echo "File does not exist."
fi
```
